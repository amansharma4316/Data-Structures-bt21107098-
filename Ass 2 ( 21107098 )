Q 1) While traversing a single-circular linked list, which condition 
establishes that the traversing element/variable has reached the first 
element?

Answer :
The most basic element which differentiates a circular linked 
list from a normal one is its ability to repeat form a loop . The last 
node part holds the address to the first node of the list. Hence the 
most basic need is to complete the circle .
So , While traversing a single circular linked list , the last element 
of the list must be pointed towards the first element.It should 
contain the address of the first node so that the loop can be 
repeated in a circular manner.
In C++ , A most basic code of circular linked list is as follow:
/* Function to print nodes in a given Circular linked list */
void printList(Node* head)
{
 Node* temp = head;
 // If linked list is not empty
 if (head != NULL) {
 // Print nodes till we reach first node again
 do {
 cout << temp->data << " ";
 temp = temp->next;
 } while (temp != head);
 }
}


Q 2) What are the practical applications of a circular linked 
list? 
Answer :
Circular Linked lists are just a part of linked lists 
which are circular in nature . These just complicates 
their working a little because we can insert data 
anywhere in the list unlike Array data structures
.Hence it has a wide range of uses Some of its real 
life applications are:
1) Our Personal computers (PCs) utilize circular 
linked lists , where all the running applications are 
kept in a circular linked list.
2) Many multiplayer games use Circular linked lists 
to store data of players and the pointer keeps 
moving forward till the players chance ends
(Swapping of players)
3) These can also be used to create circular Queue.
4) Circular lists are used when the entire list is 
accessed one-by one in the loop
5) Implementation of Advanced Data Structures like 
Fibonacci Heap.
6) The browser cache which allows us to press BACK 
button
7) Undo functionality in Photoshop or Word
8) Circular linked lists are used in Round Robin 
scheduling .
9) Circular Linked lists are also used in Audio as well 
as Video Streaming
